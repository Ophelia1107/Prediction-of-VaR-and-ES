# Prediction-of-VaR-and-ES
This project is about learning how to model tail risk and evaluate uncertainty in extreme loss estimates using both simulated and real financial data, all implemented in R/knitr.
In this project, I will do the following:
1. Practice Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) on simulated data
2. Build POT-based estimators for extreme VaR and ES
3. Apply the methodology to real SP500 data
4. Compare with the “vanilla” bootstrap for non-extreme quantiles
